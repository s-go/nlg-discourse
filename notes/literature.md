> To account for discourse relations between messages, researchers have alternatively relied on Rhetorical Structure Theory (rst; e.g., Mann & Thompson, 1988; Scott & Sieckenius de Souza, 1990; Hovy, 1993), which also typically involved domain-specific rules. For example, Williams and Reiter (2008) used rst relations to identify ordering among messages that would maximise clarity to low-skilled readers.

> There is no consensus in the research literature on what specific discourse relations should be used in an nlg system. Probably the most commonly used set is that suggested by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1988), although many developers modify this set to cater for idiosyncrasies of their particular domain and genre. For a general discussion of different ways of classifying discourse relations, see (Maier and Hovy 1993).

> This fact, in combination with the computational expense of
planning-based approaches and the large amounts of knowledge they require, means that approaches based on these ideas are not widely used in current real-world NLG systems.

> RST defines relations between text segments (elementary or complex discourse units), based on the cognitive effect of the combination on the reader. Though connectives may be present, and sometimes signal relations, they are not considered central for determining the identified relation.
